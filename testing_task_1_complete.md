### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


#dif should be def, comma needed after card1
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
#if statement should be indented
  if card1.value > card2.value:
#card should be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2


#function needs indented
def cards_total(self, cards):
#total needs to be initialised at 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    #return should not be indented, can't add total to a string
    return "You have a total of" + total

```
